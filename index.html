										<p>Explore factors leading to customer churn in a banking context. Project goal is to develop a prediction model to answer some questions like...<br />
											- is the customer going to churn ?<br />
											- what is the probability of churn ?<br />
											- can the churn redressal be actioned timely? what would be required to enable such? <br />

										<p>There are quite a few similar sounding roles which can be performed using the skills gained in this program. A degree in data science enables candidacy to roles like Data Scientist, Data Engineer, BI Engineer, Data Analyst, ML Engineer, etc. With this project, perform a job ~ role analysis for - <br />
											* what jobs or titles get higher salaries ? <br />
											* what companies pay more ? <br />
											* does location play any role in salary variations ? <br />

										<p>The difficulty we have is related to employee access to programs that may help them manage and ultimately treat their mental health conditions, as well as the expenses connected with those services. I sum up the issue as follows: "Is it feasible to anticipate with accuracy which employees in the workplace have a mental illness, in order that they may be provided with the support and services they require as part of corporate initiatives?"</p>
